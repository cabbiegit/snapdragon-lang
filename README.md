# snapdragon-lang
Snapdragon is strongly typed and compiled. It is also a functional language. The main goal of Snapdragon is to be simplistic, structured, and fast. I took inspiration from Ruby when writing this language. "natural to read and easy to write." The syntax is designed to be fast and easy, while also being memory-safe.
